To host your Node.js backend project locally and make it start as a service, you can use a process manager like PM2. PM2 allows you to keep your application running as a service, restart it automatically if it crashes, and manage multiple processes easily. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

Step 2: Start Your Node.js Application with PM2
Navigate to your project directory using the terminal and start your Node.js application with PM2:

pm2 start server.js

Step 3: Configure PM2 Startup Script (Optional)
To ensure that your Node.js application starts as a service every time your system reboots, you can generate a startup script with the following command:

pm2 startup

Step 4: Monitor and Manage Your Application
You can monitor your application using the PM2 dashboard or the command line. To view the dashboard, run:

pm2 monit

This will open the PM2 dashboard in your terminal, allowing you to monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and other metrics of your application.

To manage your application (restart, stop, delete, etc.), you can use PM2 commands. For example:

To restart your application:
pm2 restart <app_name_or_id>

To stop your application:
pm2 stop <app_name_or_id>

To delete your application from PM2:
pm2 delete <app_name_or_id>


Replace <app_name_or_id> with the name or ID of your application as shown in the output of pm2 list.
